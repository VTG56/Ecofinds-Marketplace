##  Overview
**EcoFinds** is a sustainable second-hand marketplace built during a 8-hour hackathon.  
It empowers users to register, create profiles, list pre-owned products, browse with search and filters, manage a shopping cart, and view past purchases — all built with React, Firebase, and TailwindCSS to promote conscious consumption and circular economy.

There’s a big need for a simple, accessible platform that makes exchanging pre-owned goods smooth and trustworthy.  
**EcoFinds** solves this by making sustainable exchange fast, intuitive, and community-driven.
